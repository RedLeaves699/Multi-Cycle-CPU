# This is a Multi-Cycle RISC-V CPU implementation

## 1. Instructions

The CPU is implemented by <font size = 5 face = Times new roman>Verilog</font>. The testcases of the CPU is in the `sim_1/new/cpu_test_tb.v`.

The memory is a kind of <font size = 5 face = Times new roman>cache</font>. Not the memory. The Instruction Set Architecture is <font size = 5 face = Times new roman>RISC-V</font>.
